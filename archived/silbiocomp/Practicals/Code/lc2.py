# (1) Use a list comprehension to create a list of month,rainfall tuples where
# the amount of rain was greater than 100 mm.
 
# (2) Use a list comprehension to create a list of just month names where the
# amount of rain was less than 50 mm. 

# (3) Now do (1) and (2) using conventional loops (you can choose to do 
# this before 1 and 2 !).
