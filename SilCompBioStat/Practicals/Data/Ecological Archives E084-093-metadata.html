<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Body mass is the most obvious, and 
  arguably, the most fundamental characteristic of an organism, impacting many 
  important attributes of life history, ecology and evolution.&nbsp; The range and 
  mode of body mass for a taxonomic group reflects underlying allometeric, phylogenetic 
  and ecological constraints.&nbsp; Yet, how these factors and selective forces interact 
  to determine the characteristic body sizes seen in animals is unclear and remains 
  a major area of study in biology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This paper documents the development 
  of a body mass data set created as part of a <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename><st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> 
  for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group.&nbsp; Our purpose in 
  compiling these data was to explore the body mass similarities and differences 
  of mammals across the taxonomic hierarchy, broad geographic space, and evolutionary 
  time.&nbsp; We have used these data to compare, for example, the body mass distributions 
  of terminal Pleistocene mammals on each continent prior to the arrival of man.&nbsp; 
  Our analyses suggest they were remarkably similar and that anthropogenic hunting 
  activities, not climate change, resulted in the differences seen today (Lyons 
  et al., <i>in revision</i>). In other work, we have investigated the heritability 
  of body mass across the taxonomic hierarchy and across space and time.&nbsp; We found 
  a very high correlation of body mass among congeners, except for the very smallest 
  size classes.&nbsp; For those species under about 10g, body mass of sister species 
  tends to be very diverse (Smith <i>et al,</i> <i>in revision</i>).&nbsp; Moreover, 
  the body mass patterns seen across the taxonomic hierarchy are also recapitulated 
  across geographic space and evolutionary time.&nbsp; The broad spectrum of body mass 
  seen today was established early in the Cenozoic and has been maintained despite 
  enormous taxonomic turnover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our data set consists of the updated 
  version of <st1:city><st1:place>Wilson</st1:place></st1:city> and Reeder’s (1993) 
  taxonomic list of all known mammals of the world (N=4629 species) to which we 
  added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the literature.&nbsp; 
  Mammals occurring on more than one continent have multiple records; continent-specific 
  masses were used when available. Moreover, for four of the continents (<st1:place>Africa</st1:place>, 
  North and <st1:place>South America</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>), 
  we included the mammalian species that went extinct at the late Pleistocene 
  (an additional 230 species).&nbsp; Overall, we have 5731 rows of data.&nbsp; We defined 
  “late Pleistocene” as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, 
  and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts 
  on mammalian fauna (e.g., Klein 1984; Martin 1984; Kurten 1988; Lessa and Farina 
  1996; Flannery and Roberts 1999; Martin and Steadman 1999 and Stuart 1999). 
  About half the records in our data set are derived from previous compilations 
  (Silva and Downing 1995; Marquet and Cofre 1999; Jones et al. 2003); the remainder 
  are largely drawn directly from the primary literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The data set is fairly comprehensive 
  for oceanic mammals, and for those occurring on four of the continents (Africa, 
  Australia, South America, and North America), but is less complete for Eurasian 
  and insular species (Table 1). We have been able to obtain mass estimates for 
  4361 of the 5731 rows of data; 1372 are missing values. Most, if not all missing 
  species are poorly studied and tend to be rare, cryptic or both.&nbsp; Body mass 
  was estimated using an algorithm that prioritized in the following order:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; 
  A gender-specific estimate obtained by averaging values reported from across 
  geographic localities, these were then averaged to obtain an overall species 
  value, 2) When no geographic information was provided, gender-specific values 
  were averaged for an overall species body mass estimate, 3) If both male and 
  female masses were not available, male mass was used preferentially, averaging 
  over geographic localities if such information was available, 4) If only female 
  body mass was available, it was used, again averaging over geographic localities 
  as available. In no instance did we use generic means as a proxy for a species 
  average.&nbsp; Body mass estimates for extinct species were gathered from the primary 
  literature, from personal communications, estimated from regressions of teeth 
  measurements (e.g., Damuth and MacFadden 1990), or obtained from web databases.&nbsp; 
  The source for each datum is listed in the reference column of the data set.&nbsp; 
  All extant mammalian orders are represented, and we include several archaic 
  groups present in the late Pleistocene.&nbsp; By compiling such data from geographically 
  and historically isolated areas, we were able to compare similarities and differences 
  in mammal body mass across continents differing in species composition, current 
  and past environments and geographic history.&nbsp; Moreover, we were able to examine 
  the impact of early humans on patterns of mammalian diversity across disparate 
  regions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because our studies have focused 
  on broad macroecological patterns, we have ignored the often substantial geographic 
  body mass variation that may exist for a species.&nbsp; Estimates contained within 
  this data set thus represent a generalized species value, averaged across gender 
  and geographic space.&nbsp; Consequently, care should be taken if these values are 
  used to represent species at a particular locality and/or time.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Abstract:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The purpose of this data set was 
	to compile body mass information for all mammals on Earth so that we could 
	investigate the patterns of body mass seen across geographic and taxonomic 
	space and evolutionary time.&nbsp; We were interested in the heritability of body 
	size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family 
	and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the 
	moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic 
	space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate 
	on the patterns seen today?&nbsp; Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific 
	on each continent and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?).&nbsp; 
	These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body 
	mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on <i>Body size 
	in ecology and paleoecology:&nbsp; linking pattern and process across space, time 
	and taxonomic scales</i>).&nbsp; We began with the updated version of Wilson and 
	Reeder’s (1993) taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N=4629 
	species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled 
	from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average 
	of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities 
	to arrive at our species body mass values.&nbsp; The sources are line referenced 
	in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within 
	the metadata.&nbsp; Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur 
	on.&nbsp; Please note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller 
	compilations.&nbsp; Although we relied heavily a data set for Chiroptera by K.E. 
	Jones (N=905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N=688), and a data 
	set compiled for <st1:place>South America</st1:place> by P. Marquet (N=505), 
	these total less than half the records in the current database.&nbsp; The remainder 
	are derived from more than 150 other sources (see reference table).&nbsp; Furthermore, 
	we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, 
	North and South America and Australia (an additional 230 species). “Late Pleistocene” 
	is defined as approximately 11 ka for <st1:place>Africa</st1:place>, North 
	and <st1:place>South America</st1:place>, and as 50 ka for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
	because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates 
	contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged 
	across gender and geographic space.&nbsp; Consequently, these data are not appropriate 
	for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with 
	specific environmental conditions is important.&nbsp; All extant orders of mammals 
	are included, as well as several archaic groups (N=4859 species).&nbsp; Because 
	some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), 
	there are 5731 entries.&nbsp; We have body masses for the following:&nbsp; Artiodactyla 
	(280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea 
	(75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera 
	(3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea 
	(5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna 
	(2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata 
	(7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata 
	(5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota 
	(8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 
	records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), 
	and Xenarthra (75 records).&nbsp; </font></p>
