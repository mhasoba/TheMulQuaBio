    "The problem of calculating integrals as limits of sums requires specific methods for each function and becomes quite impractical. Fortunately, this problem can be solved with the very important result that the area problem is intrinsically related to the tangent problem.\n",

    "  \n",
    "If we consider a small increment $h$ to $x$, the new area below the curve shall be given by:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$$F(x+h) = \\int_a^{x+h} f(u)du$$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The difference between these two areas shall be approximately given by the area of the retangle with width $h$ and height $f(x)$:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$$F(x+h) - F(x) \\approx hf(x) \\implies \\displaystyle\\frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} \\approx f(x)$$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "But see that in the limit where the increment $h$ gets very small, the approximation gets exactly equal to the increment in area, and we obtain the definition of the derivative of $F(x)$:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\displaystyle\\frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = \\displaystyle\\frac{dF}{dx} = f(x).$$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This results is known as the *Fundamental theorem of Calculus*, and it say that the instantaneous rate of change of the area below a given curve $f$ at a point $x$ is given by the value of the function at that point. In other words, the area $F(x)$ is a function that, if differentiated, gives the function $f(x)$.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The function $F(x)$ is then called an **antiderivative** of $f(x)$. In general, there is a *family* of antiderivates of $f(x)$, since $\\displaystyle\\frac{d(F(x) + C)}{dx}=\\displaystyle\\frac{dF}{dx}=f(x)$, independent of the value of the constant $C$. We therefore call **indefinite integral**:\n",

    "Thus the problem of calculating the area below the curve $f(x)$ from $b$ to $c$, which, by definition, is given by the infinite sum of terms $f(x_i)\\Delta x_i$ (with $\\Delta x_i \\rightarrow 0$), can be reduced to obtaining the antiderivative of $f$, $F(x)$, and subtracting the values of this function at points $c$ and $b$. The main problem then becomes how to calculate the antiderivates of a given function $f(x)$, for which different methods can be used."
