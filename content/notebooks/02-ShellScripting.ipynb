    "Instead of typing all the UNIX commands we need to perform one after the other, we can save them all in a file (a \"script\") and execute them all at once. Recall from the [UNIX and Linux Chapter](./01-Unix.ipynb#Meet-the-UNIX-shell) that the bash shell (or terminal) is a text command processor that interfaces with the Operating System. The bash shell provides a computer language that can be used to build scripts (AKA shell scripts) that can be run through the terminal."

    "\n",
    "It is possible to write reasonably sophisticated programs with shell scripting, but the bash language is not featured to the extent that it can replace a \"proper\" language like C, Python, or R. However, you will find that shell scripting is necessary. This is because as such, as you saw in the previous chapter, UNIX has an incredibly powerful set of tools that can be used thorugh the bash terminal. Shell scripts can allow you to automate the usage of these commands and create your own, simple utility tools/scripts/programs for tasks such as backups, converting file formats, handling & manipulating files and directories). This enables you to perform many everyday tasks on your computer without having to invoke another language that might require installation or updating.\n",
