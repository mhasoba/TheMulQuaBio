    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management and tracking of changes to computer code and other certain other types of data in an automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any project (collections of files in directories) under version control has changes and additions/deletions to its files and directories recorded and archived over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is in fact the technology embedded in the versioning of various word processor and spreadsheet applications (e.g., Google Docs, Overleaf).\n",

    "## Why Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "With version control of biological computing projects, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. record all changes made to a set of files and directories, including text (usually ASCII) data files, so that you can access any previous version of the files\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"roll back\" data, code, documents that are in plain text format (other file formats can also be versioned; see [section on binary files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* collaborate more easily with others on developing new code or writing documents &ndash; branch (and merge) projects\n",
    "\n",
    "* back up your project (but git is not a backup software - see [sections on binary and large files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below). \n",

    "In git, each user stores a complete local copy of the project, including the history and all versions. So you do not rely as much on a centralized (remote) server. First, install and configure `git`:"

    "\n",
    "A binary file is computer-readable but not human-readable, that is, it cannot be read by opening them in a text viewer. Examples of binary files include compiled executables, zip files, images, word documents and videos. In contrast, text files are stored in a form (usually ASCII) that is human-readable by opening in a text reader (e.g., gedit). Without some git extensions and configurations (coming up next), binary files cannot be properly version-controlled because each version of the entire file is saved *as is* in a hidden directory in the repository (`.git`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with some more effort, git can be made to work for binary formats like `*.docx` or image formats such as `*.jpeg`, but it is harder to compare versions; have a look at [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) and [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes)<sup>[1](#git:word)</sup>, and also, [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/8/how-manage-binary-blobs-git-part-7)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with large files\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, git was designed for version control of workflows and software projects, *not* large files (say, &gt;100mb) (which may be plain-text or binary). Binary files are particularly problematic because each version of the file is saved *as is* in `.git`, when you have a large number of versions it means that there are the same number of binary files in the hidden directory (for example 100 $\\times$ &gt;100mb files!).\n",
    "\n",
    "*So please do not keep large files (especially binary files) under version control*<sup>[2](#git:largefiles)</sup>. For example, if you are doing GIS work, you may have to handle large raster image files.  Do not bring such files under version control. We suggest that you include files larger than some size in your `.gitignore`. For example, you can use the following bash command:"

If you have written such code, then you can include a smaller file as a MWE (minimum working example).   \n",
    "\n",
    "*And how do you back up your large data files?* Remember, version control software like git are not meant for backing up data. The solution is to back up separately, either to an external hard drive or a cloud service. `rsync` is a great Linux utility for making such backups. Google it! \n",
