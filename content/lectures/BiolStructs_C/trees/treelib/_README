treelib.c
treelib.h

This folder contains basic code for allocating memory for tree structures in memory. The basic definitions of data types and the function prototypes are in treelib.h. The treelib.c file contains all of the function definitions for this. 

To include these functions in your program, simply add these files to your source folder with your file containing the main function. Then have the line:

#include "treelib.h" 

near the top of that file along with all the other #include statements

You can now use any function whose prototype lives in treelib.h within the body of your source code.

When you compile the program, simply include the treelib.c source file with your compilation. For instance:

gcc myprogram.c treelib.c
