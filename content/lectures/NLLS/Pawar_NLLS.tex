\begin{frame}{What makes a model non-linear?}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]\itemsep10pt

	\item OLS can be used to fit (model) equations that are {\it intrinsically linear},
	e.g.,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	Straight line: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i$
		\item Polynomial (quadratic): $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i$
		\item Another quadratic: $y_i = e^{\beta_0} + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i$
	\end{itemize} 	
	\item What is {\it intrinsic linearity}? --- 
	the equation of the model to be fitted should be a {\it sum} of {\it linear terms}, i.e., the combination of {\it coefficient} (one of the $\beta$'s) and {\it variables} (the $x_i$'s):
	\item Some non-linear models:  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $y_i = \beta_0 x_i^{\beta_1} + \varepsilon_i$
		\item $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i^{\beta_2} + \varepsilon_i$
		\item $y_i = \beta_0 e^{\beta_2 x_i} + \varepsilon_i$
		\item $y_i = \frac{\beta_0 x_i}{\beta_1 + x_i} + \varepsilon_i$
	\end{itemize}
	\pause In all of these, at least one term is non-linear (e.g., $x_i^{\beta_2}$, $e^{\beta_2 x_i}$, etc.) 
		
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Least-Squares Solution}

{\bf Recall what the Least Squares method does:}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->] \itemsep10pt

		\item Consider data on a response variable $y$, a predictor (independent) variable $x$, and $n$ observations. 
		
		\item Say we want to fit a model to these data: $
		f(x_i,\boldsymbol\beta) + \varepsilon_i $ 
		($\boldsymbol\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots,\beta_k)$ are 
		the model's $k+1$ parameters) 
		
		\item An example of $f(x_i,\boldsymbol\beta) + \varepsilon_i $ could be:
		$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i$ (linear regression)

		\item The objective of any {\it least squares} method is to find estimates of values of the parameters ($\hat{\beta_j}$) that {\it minimize} the sum ($S$) of squared residuals ($r_i$) (AKA RSS):
		
		$$
		\text{RSS} = S = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n{\left[ y_i - f(x_i,\boldsymbol\beta) 
		\right]^2} = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n{r_i^2}
		$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The NLLS fitting / optimization process}

The general procedure / algorithm is:

\begin{enumerate}[<+->] \itemsep4pt
	\item Start with an initial value for each parameter in the model
	\item Generate the curve defined by the initial values
	\item Calculate the residual sum-of-squares (RSS)
	\item Adjust the parameters to make the curve come closer to the data 
	points. {\it This the tricky part --- more on this in the next slide}
	\item Adjust the parameters again so that the curve comes even closer 
	to the points (RSS decreases)
	\item Repeat 4--5
	\item Stop simulations when the adjustments make virtually no 
	difference to the RSS
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{NLLS fitting / optimization algorithms}

The {\it tricky part --- adjust parameters to make curve come closer to 
the data points} (step 4) --- has two main algorithms that are generally used:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]\itemsep10pt

	\item The {\bf Gauss-Newton} algorithm is often used, but doesn't work very well if the model to be fitted is mathematically complicated (the parameter search ``landscape'' is difficult) and the {\it starting values} for parameters are far-off-optimal
	
	\item The {\bf Levenberg-Marquardt} algorithm switches between
	Gauss-Newton and ``gradient descent'' and is more robust against starting
	values that are far-off-optimal and is more reliable in most scenarios.  
	
\end{itemize}   

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{NLLS fits -- assessment and reporting}

\begin{itemize}[<+->] \itemsep6pt
\item Once the NLLS fitting is done, you need to get the {\it goodness of fit measures}

\item First, of course, examine the fits visually

\item Report the goodness-fit results:

	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Sums of deviations of the data points from the final model 
		fit (final RSS)
		\item Estimated coefficients
		\item For each coefficient, standard error (can be used for CI's), t-statistic and corresponding (two-tailed) p-value 
	\end{itemize} 

\item You will learn to calculate all these in the practicals   

\item You may also want to {\it compare and select between multiple competing  models}  

\item Unlike in Linear Models, R$^2$ values {\it should not} be used to interpret the quality of a NLLS fit (more on this in the practicals).    

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{NLLS Assumptions}

NLLS-regression has all the assumptions of OLS-regression:
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]\itemsep10pt
		
		\item No (in practice, minimal) measurement error in explanatory 
		variable ($x$-axis variable)
		
		\item Data have constant normal variance --- errors in the $y$-axis 
		are homogeneously distributed over the $x$-axis range
		
		\item The measurement/observation errors are Normally distributed (Gaussian) 
		% \pause 
		% --- for example, what would the error distribution of this 
		% non-linear model be: $y_i = \beta_0 e^{\beta_2 x_i} + 
		% \varepsilon_i$? \pause
		
		\item What if the errors are not normal? --- Interpret results
		cautiously, and use Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian fitting methods instead
