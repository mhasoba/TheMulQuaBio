    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management and tracking of changes to computer code and other certain other types of data in an automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any project (collections of files in directories) under version control has changes and additions/deletions to its files and directories recorded and archived over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is in fact the technology embedded in the versioning of various word processor and spreadsheet applications (e.g., Google Docs, Overleaf).\n",

    "## Why Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "With version control of biological computing projects, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. record all changes made to a set of files and directories, including text (usually ASCII) data files, so that you can access any previous version of the files\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"roll back\" data, code, documents that are in plain text format (other file formats can also be versioned; see [section on binary files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* collaborate more easily with others on developing new code or writing documents &ndash; branch (and merge) projects\n",
    "\n",
    "* back up your project (but git is not a backup software - see [sections on binary and large files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below). \n",

    "|`git branch name`|    Create new branch |\n",
    "|`git checkout name`|  Switch to a different commit/branch called `name`|\n",
    "|`git fetch`|          Gather commits info from a remote branch to your current local branch without merging them|\n",
    "|`git merge`|          Merge two or more versions of one or more files|\n",
    "|`git pull`|           Upload from remote repository (this is effectively the same as `fetch` followed by `merge`)|\n",

    "\n",
    "If you do need to include a **small** csv file, image, or output (such as when creating reports or including test data) it is a good idea to do this using exceptions (aka the ! symbol)\n",

    "```\n",

    "!pushabledata.csv\n",
    "```\n",

    "Gitignore files are usually used as a blacklist: where anything you add to your git repository is allowed unless you specifically outlaw it in the gitignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative, safer technique (though one which is definitely more work to maintain) is a whitelist-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you firstly ignore every file with the pattern `*.*` and then explicitly allow files and file types that you _know_ you want. For example:\n",

    "## Dealing with binary files\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary file is computer-readable but not human-readable, that is, it cannot be read by opening them in a text viewer. Examples of binary files include compiled executables, zip files, images, word documents and videos. In contrast, text files are stored in a form (usually ASCII) that is human-readable by opening in a text reader (e.g., gedit). Without some git extensions and configurations (coming up next), binary files cannot be properly version-controlled because each version of the entire file is saved *as is* in a hidden directory in the repository (`.git`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with some more effort, git can be made to work for binary formats like `*.docx` or image formats such as `*.jpeg`, but it is harder to compare versions; have a look at [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) and [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes)<sup>[1](#git:word)</sup>, and also, [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/8/how-manage-binary-blobs-git-part-7)\n",

    "\n",
    "As such, git was designed for version control of workflows and software projects, *not* large files (say, &gt;100mb) (which may be plain-text or binary). Binary files are particularly problematic because each version of the file is saved *as is* in `.git`, when you have a large number of versions it means that there are the same number of binary files in the hidden directory (for example 100 $\\times$ &gt;100mb files!).\n",
    "\n",
    "*So please do not keep large files (especially binary files) under version control*<sup>[2](#git:largefiles)</sup>. For example, if you are doing GIS work, you may have to handle large raster image files.  Do not bring such files under version control. We suggest that you include files larger than some size in your `.gitignore`. For example, you can use the following bash command:"

If you have written such code, then you can include a smaller file as a MWE (minimum working example).   \n",
    "\n",
    "*And how do you back up your large data files?* Remember, version control software like git are not meant for backing up data. The solution is to back up separately, either to an external hard drive or a cloud service. `rsync` is a great Linux utility for making such backups. Google it! \n",

    "_THIS IS NORMAL_\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about it, this has happened to pretty much everyone who has ever used git.\n",

    "When things like this do happen though, it is imperative that you work out _what_ went wrong so you can make sure it doesn't happen again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to ask yourself include:\n",
    "- Did I use `git status` to check what I was adding?\n",
    "- Did I commit regularly enough, whenever I had completed a logical section of work?\n",
    "- Did I make sure to only commit code rather than committing data files and outputs too?\n",
    "- Did I make sure to gitignore the things I needed to?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get used to working with git, it becomes as natural as juggling chainsaws: i.e. it will always feel a bit odd and strange but it won't be as scary as it once was."
