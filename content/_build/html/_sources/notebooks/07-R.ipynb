    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The R part of this course aims to lay down the foundations for you to use R for scientific computing in biology by exploiting it full potential as a fully featured object-oriented programming language. Specifically, this chapter aims at teaching you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic R syntax and programming conventions, assuming you have never set your eyes on R\n",
    "* Principles of data processing and exploration (including visualization) using R\n",
    "* Principles of clean and efficient programming using R\n",
    "* To generate publication quality graphics in R \n",
    "* To develop reproducible data analysis \"work flows\" so you (or anybody else) can run and re-run your analyses, graphics outputs and all, in R \n",
    "* To make R simulations more efficient using vectorization\n",
    "* To find and fix errors in R code using debugging \n",
    "* T make data wrangling and analyses more efficient and convenient using custom tools such as `tidyr`\n",
    "* Some additional tools and topics in R (accessing databases, building your own packages, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a freely available statistical software with strong  programming capabilities widely used by professional scientists around  the world. It was based on the commercial statistical software `S` by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka. The first stable version appeared  in 2000. \n",
    "\n",
    "R was essentially designed for *programming* statistical  analysis and data-mining. It became the standard tool for data  analysis and visualization in biology in a matter of just 10 years or so. It is also increasingly being used for modelling in biology. This is because R has: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Many tried and tested packages to perform practically all statistical analysis\n",
    "* Numerous packages for data-handling and processing   \n",
    "* Excellent graphing and visualization capabilities\n",
    "* Good capabilities for mathematical calculations, including matrix algebra \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why R?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many commercial statistical (minitab, SPSS, etc) software  packages in the world that are mouse-driven, warm, and friendly, and  have lots of statistical tests and plotting/graphing capabilities. Why not just use them? Here are some very good reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* R is scriptable, so you can build a perfectly repeatable record of your analysis. This in itself has several advantages:\n",
    "   * You can never replicate *exactly* the same analysis with all the same steps using a point-and-click approach/software. With R you can reproduce your full analysis for yourself (in the future!), your colleagues, your supervisor/employer, and any journal you might want to submit your work to.\n",
    "   * You may need to rerun your analysis every time you get new data. Once you have it all in a R script, you can just rerun your     analysis and go home!\n",
    "   * You may need to tweak your analysis many times (new data, supervisor changes mind, you change mind, paper reviewers want you do something differently). Having the analysis recorded as script then allows you to do so by revising the relevant parts of your analysis with relatively little pain.  \n",
    "* R provides basically every statistical test you'll ever need and is constantly being improved &ndash;  you can tailor your analyses rather than trying to use the more limited options each statistical software package can offer. \n",
    "* R can produce publication-quality graphics that can be re-produced with scripts &ndash; you won't get [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) mouse-clicking your way though graphing and re-graphing your data every time you change your analysis!\n",
    "* R is freely available for all common computer operating systems &ndash; if you want a copy on your laptop, help yourself  at the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org).\n",
    "* Being able to program in R means you can develop and automate your own data handling, statistical analysis, and graphing/plotting, a set of skills you are likely to need in many, if not most careers paths!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Would you ever need anything other than R?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to program R means you can develop and automate your statistical analyses and the generation of figures into a reproducible work flow. For many of you, using R as your only programming language will do the job. However, if your work also includes extensive numerical simulations, manipulation of very large matrices, bioinformatics, relational database access and manipulation, or web development, you will be better-off *also* knowing another programming language that is more versatile and computationally efficient (like Python, C, or Julia).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing R\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a college computer, R will likely already be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise you can follow [these instructions](https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/rstudio.html) to install R on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, on Ubuntu Linux, it is as simple as typing the following in terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be using an IDE for R. Please re-visit the [\"To IDE or not to IDE\" section of the introduction](../intro.md) if you are not familiar with IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly look at the bare-bones R interface and command line  interface (CLI), and then switch to an IDE like VS Code or RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch R (From Applications menu on Window or Mac, from terminal in  Linux/Ubuntu) &mdash; it should look something like this (on Linux/Ubuntu or Mac terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./graphics/R_Linux.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or like this (Windows \"console\", similar in Mac):\n",
    " \n",
    "![image](./graphics/R_terminal.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## R basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets get started with some R basics. You will be working by entering R commands interactively at the R user prompt (`>`). Up and down arrow keys scroll through your command history. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful R commands\n",
    "\n",
    "|Command| What it does|\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "| `ls()`| list all the variables in the work space |\n",
    "| `rm('a', 'b')`| remove variable(s) `a` and `b`|\n",
    "| `rm(list=ls())`| remove all variable(s)|\n",
    "| `getwd()`| get current working directory |\n",
    "| `setwd('Path')`| set working directory to `Path`|\n",
    "| `q()`| quit R |\n",
    "| `?Command`| show the documentation of `Command`|\n",
    "| `??Keyword`| search the all packages/functions with 'Keyword', \"fuzzy search\"|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baby steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in any programming language, you will need to use \"variables\" to store information in a R session's workspace. Each variable has a reserved location in your [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory), and takes up \"real estate\" in it &mdash; that is when you create a variable you reserve some space in your computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Data \"structures\" vs. \"objects\" in R**: You will often see the terms \"object\" and \"data structure\" thrown around in this and other chapters. These two have a very distinct meaning in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like R and Python. A data structure is just a \"dumb\" container for data (e.g., a vector). An object, on the other hand can be a data structure, but also any other variable or a function in your R environment. R, being an OOP language, converts everything in the current environment to an object so that it knows what to do with each such entity &mdash; each object type has its own set of rules for operations and manipulations that R uses when interpreting your commands. \n",

The problem is that dataframes can be too slow when large numbers of mathematical calculations or operations (e.g., matrix - vector multiplications or other linear algebra operations) need to be performed. In such cases, you will need to convert a dataframe to a matrix. But for statistical analyses, plotting, and writing output of standard R analyses to a file, data frames are more convenient. Dataframes also allow you to refer to columns by name (using `$`), which is often convenient.\n",

These are typically based on a iterative formula that generates a sequence of random numbers, starting with a first number called the \"**seed**\". This sequence is completely \"deterministic\", that is, starting with a particular seed yields exactly the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers every time you re-run the generator. \n",

However, this  period is so long that it can be ignored for most practical purposes. So effectively, `rnorm` has an enormous list that it cycles through.

You can then set R to work from this directory, so that files are easy to find and run &mdash; this will be your \"working directory\" (more on this below).

    "* *Text data files* These are files of data in plain text format containing one or more columns of data (numbers, strings, or both). Although there are several format options, we will typically be using `csv` files, where the data entries are separated by commas. These are easy to create and export from Excel (if that's what you use...).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Results output files* These are a plain text files containing your results, such the the summary of output of a regression or ANOVA analysis. Typically, you will output your results in a table format where the columns are separated by commas (csv) or tabs (tab-delimited). \n",

    "The `../` in `read.csv(\"../data/trees.csv\")` above signifies a \"relative\" path. That is, you are asking R to load data that lies in a different directory (folder) *relative* your current location (in this case, you are in your ` Code`directory). In other, more technical words, `../data/trees.txt`points to a file named `trees.txt`located in the \"parent\" of the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is an absolute path?* &mdash; one that specifies the whole path on your computer, say from ` C:\\`\"upwards\" on Windows, `/Users/` upwards on Mac, and `/home/` upwards on Linux. Absolute paths are specific to each computer, so should be avoided. So to import data and export results, your script should *not* use absolute paths. Also, *AVOID putting a `setwd()`command at the start of your R script*, because setting the working directory requires an absolute directory path, which will differ across computers, platforms, and users. Let the end users set the working directory on their machine themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using relative paths in in your R scripts and code will make your code computer-independent and easier for others to use your code. The relative path way should always be the way you load data in your analyses scripts &mdash; it will guarantee that your analysis works on every computer, not just your own or college computer. \n",

There you will also see a comparison of speed of `ddply` vs `by` at the latter web page; `ddply` is actually slower than other vectorized methods, as it trades-off compactness of use for some of the speed of vectorization! Indeed, overall functions in ` plyr` can be slow if you are working with very large datasets that involve a lot of subsetting (analyses by many groups or grouping variables). \n",

    "A very convenient tool for R unit testing is [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org).\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, you can use other \"[defensive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming)\" methods in R to keep an eye on errors that might arise in special circumstances in an complex program. A good option for this is to convert warnings to errors using the [`stopifnot()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/stopifnot.html). This is a bit like `try` (which we will cover below, and we also covered in {ref}`Python Chapter I <Python:errors>`). "

    "### Autocorrelation in weather\n",
    "\n",
    "This Practical assumes you know about correlation coefficients and p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to write an R script that will help answer the question: *Are temperatures of one year significantly correlated with the next year (successive years), across years in a given location*? For this, you need to calculate the correlation between $n-1$ pairs of years, where $n$ is the total number of years. However, you can't use the standard p-value calculated for a correlation coefficient, because measurements of climatic variables in successive time-points in a time series (successive seconds, minutes, hours, months, years, etc.) are *not independent*. The general guidelines are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Make a new script named ` TAutoCorr.R`, and save in ` code`directory\n",
    " * At the start of the script, load and examine and plot `KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.Rdata`, using ` load()`. This is the temperature in Key West, Florida for the 20th century.\n",
    " * Now extend the script to:\n",
    "     * Compute the appropriate correlation coefficient between successive years and store it (look at the help file for `cor()`\n",
    "     * Repeat this calculation 10000 times by &ndash; randomly permuting the time series, and then recalculating the correlation coefficient for each randomly permuted year sequence and storing it. \n",
    "     *Hint*: you can use the `sample` function that we learned about). Read the help file for this function and experiment with it. \n",
    "     *  Then calculate what fraction of the correlation coefficients from the previous step were greater than that from step 1 (this is your approximate p-value).\n",
    " * *How do you interpret these results? Why?* Present your results and their interpretation in a pdf document written in $\\LaTeX$ (please include the the document's source code as well).\n",

    "### Groupwork Practical on Tree Heights\n",

    "The goal of this practical is to make the `TreeHeight.R` Groupwork script more general, so that it could be used for other datasets, not just `trees.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Write another R script called `get_TreeHeight.R` that takes a csv file name from the command line (e.g., `get_TreeHeight.R Trees.csv`) and outputs the result to a file just like ` TreeHeight.R`above, but this time includes the input file name in the output file name as ` InputFileName_treeheights.csv`. Note that you will have to strip the `.csv`or whatever the extension is from the filename, and also ` ../`etc., if you are using relative paths. (Hint: Command-line parameters are accessible within the R running environment via `commandArgs()` &mdash; so `help(commandArgs)` might be your starting point.)\n",
    "  * Write a Unix shell script called ` run_get_TreeHeight.sh` that tests ` get_TreeHeight.R`. Include `trees.csv`as your example file. Note that     ` source`will not work in this case as it does not allow scripts with arguments to be run; you will have to use ` Rscript`instead. \n",

    "### Practicals wrap-up\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Review and make sure you can run all the commands, code fragments, and named scripts we have built till now and get the expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Annotate/comment your code lines as much and as often as necessary using #.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Keep all files organized in ` code`, ` data`and `results` directories\n",
