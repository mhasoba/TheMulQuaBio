    "In this chapter you will learn how to use R to explore your data and determine appropriate statistical analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you would like to design experiments (manipulations and/or observations) that are appropriate for the question you want to answer. However, you still need to explore you data to determine what kind of statistical analyses are appropriate for your data, because: \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Your experiments or observations may not go as planned (do they ever?), and \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) You might have somebody else's data to analyse (very common in this era of \"Big Data\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have worked through this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provided sufficient information is available, be able to judge whether the sampling design used to generate a particular dataset was appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate basic statistical measures on your data to determine its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine if your sample sizes are adequate, especially for a specific statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start off with the simplest of scenarios for statistical testing — that you want to determine whether a sample, or a pair of samples meet some expectation (hypothesis) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some let's revisit some key concepts and terminology. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some statistical parlance\n",
    "\n",
    "The following terms are important for you to get familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(Statistical) Population**: A *complete set* of items that share at least one *attribute* of interest. This attribute of interest is the target of your statistical analysis. For example, if we are interested in studying the weight of year-old cod in the Oceans, the population consists of *all* year-old cod, but more specifically, the weight measurements of all the individuals of the cod population is what we want to analyse.\n",

    "**Collapse of Atlantic cod stocks off the East Coast of Newfoundland in 1992.** <br>(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery))\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(Statistical) Distribution**: A mathematical description (expressed as a mathematical equation) of the properties of a population of interest. Theoreticians have come up with a bunch of distributions (e.g., Gaussian or Normal, Poisson, Binomial, etc.) that are appropriate for different kinds of data. Figuring out which distribution best describes a population of interest is one of the first steps in a statistical analysis. The primary goal of experimental design is to collect and measure sufficient individuals of a population to adequately characterize the statistical properties of an attribute (e.g., body weight of yearling cod) of interest. That is, the *statistical distribution* that best characterizes the attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(Data or Population) Sample**: A data *sample* is a set of measurements of the attribute of interest collected from a  (statistical) *population* (all the individuals of interest) by a defined procedure (*sampling methodology*). In the cod example above, this could be the weight of every individual of a *subset* (the *sample*) of the year-old cod population. This could be from a particular location, such as the Atlantic ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(Statistical) Parameter** :   A measure of some attribute of the (theoretical) *statistical distribution* that is supposed to represent your population. An example would be the average weight of *all* yearling cod, which presumably follow some sort of distribution. In practice, this is not measurable because the population is much too large or incompletely inaccessible/invisible — imagine measuring the weight of every year-old cod individual in the Atlantic ocean!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statistic**(singular):  An *estimate* of a statistical parameter of the population of interest, obtained by calculating the measure for a *sample*. An example would be the average or mean weight of individuals in a sample of one-year old cod in the Atlantic Ocean. This is also known as a *descriptive statistic*. Therefore, a *Statistic* is to a *Statistical Parameter* what a  *Sample* is to the (Statistical) *Population*. For example, the average of a sample of cod weights is a statistic that  *estimates* the \"real\" average of the weights of the entire one-year Cod population (which is its statistical parameter). This real average is also the mean value of the theoretical distribution (e.g., Gaussian) that the population is expected to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis**: An informed  *postulate* about an attribute of your population of interest. For example, you may hypothesize that the one-year old cod population's mean weight has declined over the last two decades because of preferential fishing of larger individuals. You will typically confront your main hypothesis with a *Null Hypothesis*, to minimize the risk of making a significant *Type I error*. This is the probability of wrongly accepting an *alternative (or main) hypothesis* even is not really true, and rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., the yearling cods have in reality not declined in weight, but you wrongly infer that they have). This is a big NO NO from a scientific and philosophical standpoint. The rate or probability of the Type I error is denoted by the Greek letter $\\alpha$, and equals the *significance level* of a statistical test. Wrongly rejecting a true alternative (main) hypothesis is also  a *Type II* error\n",

    "## Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The key statistical measures that describe a sample (or a population) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Mean**  (or average, or more precisely, the arithmetic mean)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean):  This is a measure of the [*central tendency*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency) of the sample and population (what values most of the data tend to have). Given a sample $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$ of size $n$, the mean is typically denoted by a $\\bar{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} =  \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \\dots +x_{n}}{n} = \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, it is the sum of all the values in a sample divided by the number, $n$, of items in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Standard deviation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation): A measure of spread of the population around the mean. This is typically denoted by $s$,and is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\bar{x} - x_{1})^{2} + (\\bar{x} - x_{2})^2 + \\dots + (\\bar{x} - x_{n})^{2}}{n-1}} =  \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\bar{x} - x_{i})^2}{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, it is the square root of the sum of squares (\"SS\") of the differences between each item in the sample and the mean, divided by the *degrees of freedom, \"df\"* remaining in the data set ($n-1$). df is the sample size, $n$, minus the number of statistical parameters estimated from the data set. This is to reduce the  *bias* in your *estimate* of the statistic, as you are calculating it from the sample, and not the whole theoretical population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the formula for $s$ above has $n-1$ in its denominator because, to work out the standard deviation, you must have already estimated the mean ($\\bar{x}$) from the same data set. This removes 1 degree of freedom. Also, note that the sample variance, $s^2$ is the square of standard deviation. Or, in other words, the standard deviation is the square-root of the variance!\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Median**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median): The above two statistics (mean and sd) are particularly meaningful when the sample and population have a symmetric distribution (e.g., normal or gaussian). When the distribution is not symmetric (that is, it is [*skewed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness)), the *median*  is a better measure of central tendency. This is the middle value in the ordered set of data. That is, exactly 50% of the data lie below and 50% lie above the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other descriptive statistics you should keep in mind is the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)) (difference between the largest and smallest values), and the [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) (values lying in the data divided into the intervals $[{1\\over4}, {1\\over 2},{3\\over 4}, 1]$ or at 1% intervals (percentiles). Box-plots, which you have seen, represent a number of these statistics in one figure, as you will soon learn in practice below.\n",

    "Here are the R commands for the key descriptive statistics:   \n",

    "## Data types and (statistical) distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "You will typically encounter or sample the following main types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous numeric**: Data that can take decimal values (real numbers) such as human height or weight. These may be unbounded (any value between negative infinity to positive infinity), or bounded (e.g., between or zero and some upper positive number) like human weight. This is the `numeric` or `real` data type in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Discrete numeric**: Integer (whole) numbers such as counts of individuals in a population, e.g., The number of bacteria in a ml of pond water. This is the `int` data type in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percentage (proportion)**: A particular kind of numeric data that is strictly bounded between 0 and 100. The fact that you can never get samples of percentages that exceed these bounds makes such data tricky to analyse. This also falls under the `numeric` or `real` data type in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Categorical**: Consisting of a fixed number of discrete categories. These are typically stored as a *factor* in R, with the categories stored as *levels* in character (string) data type format. For example, the factor \"Type.of.feeding.interaction\" from the predator-prey dataset you have [used previously](08-Data_R.ipynb#Basic-plotting-commands) had five levels: \"insectivorous\", \"piscivorous\", \"planktivorous\", \"predacious\", and \"predacious/piscivorous\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary (presence/absence)**: A special type of categorical data are binary, where only two categories/states/values are possible: (1, 0) (or \"present\", \"absent\") (e.g., a disease symptom). These may be stored as integer, character, or boolean (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "While designing experiments or exploring data, you need to keep in mind that each data type will often be best-represented by a particular *statistical distribution*. For example, continuous numeric data are *often* normally distributed. On the other hand, count data are likely to be distributed according to the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are lucky, you will mostly have to deal with data that are continuous or discrete numeric, which are the most straightforward to analyse using Linear models (more on that in subsequent chapters). However, some of the most interesting and important problems in biology involve proportion (percentage), categorical and binary data (e.g., Presence or absence of a disease symptom).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think about what type of data, and what type of distribution, a sample of the following is likely to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wavelength of light\n",
    "* Temperature\n",
    "* Egg clutch size\n",
    "* Rate of a reaction\n",

    "### Some general tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is a bit of an art.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why *a priori* visualization is important, and directly cutting to the (statistical) chase can often leave one floundering with confusing coefficient estimates and model fits (or over-fits) and overall uncertainty about whether you have picked the right statistical test. \n",
    "\n",
    "* So no matter what, always first look at the distribution of the response (the \"raw data\"). If you see multi-modality (multiple peaks), it might mean that some process or effect is generating it. So, in the dragonfly-damselfly example below, a preliminary visualization of the densities of genome size immediately tell you that there are actually two populations (e.g., two levels of  effects, or a process that generates the two populations with different central tendencies $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_B$). \n",
    "\n",
    "* If it is a regression-type problem, look at the marginal distributions (distributions of the x and y variables) - similar insights can be gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, one can look at the distributions within the effects to look for consistency of both shape (sample of the underlying population's distribution type) and spread (sample of the underlying population's variance). \n",
    "    * If there is consistency in both, the battle is pretty much won, because normal or not, there are statistical methods (GLMs, for example) that can be used. \n",
    "    * If there is consistency in distribution type but not in variance, half the battle is won. Unequal variances very often tend to be a problem with unbalanced sampling (across effects/treatments), so you can throw in mixed effects (so, GLMMs) which allows you to use empirical information (the data) across effects to help correct for it. \n",
    "    * And also, very often, tests are robust to unequal variances (you would need to find a statistical paper, or do your own simulations to support this - so very often better to stick with mixed effects). \n",
    "    * If there is consistency in variance but not shape, or inconsistency in both, then you have a harder problem, and may have to resort to transforming some data and not others (not ideal, to be avoided).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A case study\n",

    "## Take a quick look at effects of certain factors\n",
    "\n",
    "R has a special way of describing a model that defines the response variable and the explanatory variables (\"factors\"). This is called a 'formula' and is used to define linear models (more on these in a later chapters). The same structure is used in many plotting functions and will put the response variable on the $y$ axis and the explanatory variable on the $x$ axis. The structure is \"response variable ~ explanatory variables\". We will look at multiple explanatory variables in a later chapter but an example with one explantory variable (factor) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Genome Size ~ Suborder`\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula tells R to model genome size 'as a function of' (`~`) the suborders of Odonata. When using this syntax in a `boxplot` function, the result will be to plot genome size as a function of the suborders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compare distribution of the variable across levels of a factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Although looking at the distribution of variables is a good first step, we often want to compare distributions. In this case, we might want to know how genome size varies between dragonflies and damselflies. The first way we will look at is using boxplots — these show the median and the 25% and 75% quantiles as a box, with whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum. More extreme outliers are plotted independently as points. The `plot` function in R automatically generates a boxplot when the explanatory variable is a factor (i.e., provided you have the necessary grouping columns deignated to be the `factor` class; review the variable types and data structures sections of [the R Chapter](07-R.ipynb) if this sounds like greek to you).\n",

To explore this possibility, we need to plot the two orders using different colours or plot characters. In the next code block, we will customize the plots to show different types of points for each suborder.
