An object, on the other hand can be a data structure, but also any other variable or a function. Python, being an OOP language, converts everything in the current environment to an object so that it knows what to do with each such entity &mdash; each object type has its own set of rules for operations and manipulations that Python uses when interpreting your commands. \n",

So, in summary, shallow copying an object won't create objects that are independent clones, i.e., the copy is not fully independent of the original. A deep copy of an object will recursively clone \"child\" objects (like nested parts of a list). The clone is fully independent of the original, but creating a deep copy is slower, as it involves assigning new memory space. Keep in mind that this shallow vs. deep copy business does  not just apply to lists. You can copy arbitrary objects (including custom classes) with the copy module.\n",

    "**Why Python \"shallow\" copies objects:** This is a bit of a technical detail, but important to keep in mind: Python does shallow copying of mutable objects for (computing) performance considerations. By not copying the underlying object when you re-assign a mutable object to a new (\"variable\") name, Python avoids unnecessary memory usage. This is known as \"passing by reference\" (in contrast to passing by \"value\", where a new variable would be actually created in memory). That does not change the fact that shallow vs. deep copying can be confusing, of course!\n",

    "Why bother with modules? Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keeping code compartmentalized is good for debugging, unit testing, and profiling (coming up later)\n",
    "* Makes code more compact by minimizing redundancies (write repeatedly used code segments as a module)\n",

    "\n",
    "A Python package is simply a directory of Python modules (quite like an `R` package). Many packages, such as the following that I find particularly useful, are always available as standard libraries (just require `import` from within python or ipython):\n",

    "* `math`: for mathematical functions\n",

    "for efficient data crunching\n",
    "* `matplotlib` for plotting (very matlab-like, requires `scipy`) (all packaged in `pylab`)\n",

    "* [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org) for applying different machine learning algorithms to data\n",
    "* `ipython` is an enhanced python terminal (which you are currently using)\n",

    "\n",
    "Open `align_seqs.py` from TheMulQuaBio's code directory. This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. Run the script and make sure you understand what every line is doing. A good way to do this, now that you have learnt debugging, is to insert a breakpoint (`import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`) at key locations in the script and examine what is going on. For example, inserting one just after the start of the `for` loop of the `calculate_score` function/module is a good place.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The aligning algorithm is simple. Start by positioning the beginning of the shorter sequence at all positions (bases) of the longer one (the start position), and count the number of bases matched downstream. Then, for each start position, count the \"score\" as total of number of bases matched. The alignment with the highest score wins. Ties are possible, in which case, you just take the an arbitrary alignment (e.g., first or last) with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `align_seqs.py` to a Python program that takes the DNA sequences as an input from a single external file and saves the best alignment along with its corresponding score in a single text file (your choice of format and file type) to an appropriate location. No external input should be required; that is, you should still only need to use `python align_seq.py` to run it.\n",
    "    For example, the input file can be a single `.csv` file with the two example sequences given at the top of the original script.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Groupwork Practical on Align DNA sequences \n",
    "\n",
    "Align all the `.fasta` sequences from the [Unix chapter](01-Unix.ipynb). Call the new script `align_seqs_fasta.py`. Unlike `align_seqs.py`, this script should take *any* two fasta sequences (in separate files) to be aligned as input. So this script would typically run by using explicit inputs, for example, when called with something like: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 align_seqs_fasta.py seq1.fasta seq2.fasta\n",
    "``` \n",

    "\n",
    "### Groupwork Practical on Align DNA sequences 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The current script/program runs through all possible starting points on the main sequence and then just takes the first of the alignments with the highest score. This should be apparent if you closely examine this part of the script:\n",

    "for i in range(l1):\n",
    "    z = calculate_score(s1, s2, l1, l2, i)\n",

    "        my_best_score = z\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `if z > my_best_score` condition means that when a new alignment has the same score as the current one, the current one will be kept and the new one discarded. As a result, multiple alignments with the same score will be lost even if they are all equally good alignments (highly likely in longer sequences), with only the first one retained. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify the script so that all the equally-best alignments are recorded and saved to the `results` directory in an appropriate file format (Hint: recall `pickle`). Call your new script `align_seqs_better.py`.\n",

    "### Missing oaks problem\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Open and run the code `oaks_debugme.py` — there's a bug, for no oaks are being found! (*where's `TestOaksData.csv`?* — in the `data` directory of TheMulQuaBio repo!)\n",
    "*  Fix the bug (e.g., you could insert a debugging breakpoint using `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`)\n",
    "*  Now, write doctests to make sure that, bug or no bug, your `is_an_oak` function is working as expected (hint: `>>> is_an_oak('Fagus sylvatica')` should return `False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wrote good doctests, you will find another bug that you might not have by just debugging (hint: what happens if you try the doctest with \"Quercuss\" instead of \"Quercus\"? Should this pass or fail?). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify your doctests approriately, and  modify your script such that it can handle cases where there is a typo (such as 'Quercuss') or there is a genus name that is not strictly 'Quercus'. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Groupwork Practical on Missing oaks problem \n",
    "\n",

    "The genus is:\n",
    "Genus\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Modify the script so that it excludes the header row (if it exists) in its search for oaks in a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You might also have noticed that the output of the program writes a new file containing just the names of oaks. However, it does not include the column headers (\"Genus\", \"species\"). Fix this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicals wrap-up\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Review and make sure you can run all the commands, code fragments, and scripts we have till now and get the expected outputs — all scripts should work on any other linux laptop.\n",
    "* *Don't forget to add docstrings where necessary/appropriate.*\n",
    "*  Test all your scripts by running from the bash terminal in additon to from within the ipython shell (and try both `python` and `ipython` to run in the bash terminal)\n",
    "*  Include an appropriate docstring (if one is missing) at the beginning of `*each*` of each of the python script/ module files you have written, as well as at the start of every function (sub-module) in a module.\n",
    "*  Also annotate your code lines as much and as often as necessary using `#`.\n",
    "*  Keep all code files organized in `code` in your weekly directory in your coursework repository (e.g., in CMEECourseWork/Week2). \n",
