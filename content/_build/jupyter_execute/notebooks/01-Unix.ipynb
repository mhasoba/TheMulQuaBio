    "Here we are going to learn about the UNIX operating system, and in particular, it's most popular user-friendly avatar, Linux (and even more specifically, Debian based Linux distributions, with focus on Ubuntu). If you are niot a Unix/Linux user, you still need to learn the UNIX environment because under the hood, all other operating systems that need to do *serious* computing have to use Unix. Indeed, MacOS is built on UNIX, and Windows now a days has a UNUIX sub-system to enable users to things that can only really be done in UNIX (like Genomics!). "

    "\n",
    "UNIX is a machine-independent operating system (OS) developed in the 1970s by AT&T programmers (notably Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, fathers of `C`) for programmers (you!). It is multi-user and network-oriented by design, uses plain text files for storing data (no proprietary file formats), and has a strictly hierarchical directory structure (more on this below). This makes it an ideal environment for developing your code and storing your data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* It was designed for developing code and storing data &ndash; an ideal native habitat for programming languages like Python and R!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Robust, stable, secure (very few UNIX viruses and malware &ndash; I am yet to encounter one after almost 10 years!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Free and open source!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scores of small programs available to perform simple tasks &ndash; can be combined easily\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to automate tasks (e.g., using shell scripts)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-user (multiple users can log in and concurrently use computer)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-tasking (can perform many tasks at the same time)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Network-ready (easy to communicate between computers)\n",
    "\n",
    "* UNIX has been around since the early 1970's and will likely be around at the end of your career (the hard work you are putting into learning UNIX will pay off over a lifetime!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazing support &ndash; a large body of tutorials and support web sites are readily available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basically all resources for High-Performance Computing (computer clusters, large workstations, etc.) run a UNIX or Linux operating system."

    "\n",
    "That's it for our introduction to UNIX. We have just scratched the surface, but hopefully you have seen the potential for using the the UNIX/Linux terminal in particular for performing important tasks efficiently. UNIX has a incdibly wide array of commandline tools that can make your life easier. Here is a list of particularly useful commands (that often belong to a bigger toolkit; some of these will have to be installed using `apt`):\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Tool    |  What it does       |\n",
    "| :------------- |:-------------| \n",
    "|  `top`                  | Find which processes are using your memory and cpu |\n",
    "|  `killall`                  | Kill processes (use with caution) |\n",
    "|  `grep`                  | Find patterns in directory and file names, as well as file contents; really useful for combining with other tools to perform operations on specific subsets of files and directories  |\n",
    "|  `find`                  | Find files and directories|\n",
    "|  `pandoc`                  | Convert between document formats (e.g., \\LaTeX and Word or Markdown and PDF)|\n",
    "|  `convert`                  | Convert between file |\n",
    "|  `pdftk`                  | Manipulate PDF files, like merging multple ones or splitting them |\n",
    "|  `wget`                  | Download files from the web |\n",
    "|  `rsync`                  | Sync folders on your computer, including on any atatched devices (like an external hard drive) |\n",
    "|  `cron`                  | Set up automated tasks (like run a backup script based on `rsync`)|\n",
    "|  `unison`                  | Keep multiple computers synced  |\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out more about these commands and tools, look at their `man` pages. You can also use `whatis` for a brief description, or`--help` *after* the command for usage syntax. \n",
