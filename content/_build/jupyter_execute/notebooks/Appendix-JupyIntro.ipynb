    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook offers an interactive interface to multiple programming languages (including Python and R) that can be viewed and manipulated in web browsers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can run code, and also store the code and a current snapshot of the output (graphics and text), together with notes (in markdown), in an editable document called a *notebook* (like this one you are currently reading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a Jupyter notebook is similar to a [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)\n",
    " or [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) notebook. The difference is that Jupyter is free, fast improving, and unlike Mathematica or Maple notebooks, the Jupyter notebook can support almost [100 programming languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) (more on this [below](#Language-Kernels)). Furthermore, Jupyter notebooks are saved on disk as a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) files (with a .ipynb extension), so are  fully open source and can be kept under version control.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use interactive notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a great tool for \"literate programming\"; a software development style pioneered by (yes, again!) Donald Knuth. In his words:\n",
    "> *Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In literate programming, human-friendly text is as important as code, making coding accessible to a larger proportion of people. \n",
    "\n",
    "And just as importantly, literate programming also helps address the generally poor reproducibility of scientific research by making your code and your methods better reproducible and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Jupyter notebooks, you can *explore quantitative ideas* by combining snippets of computer code and human text. The main uses of Jupyter notebooks are:\n",
    "* Data science (e.g., with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/))\n",
    "* Mathematical analyses (e.g., with [sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html))\n",
    "* Interactive visualization (e.g., with [matpliotib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/))\n",
    "* Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are increasingly being used as a research tool in academic, government (e.g., NASA), as well as industry (e.g., IBM, Facebook, Microsoft & JP Morgan) sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Jupyter features\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ...allows you to keep notes using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the increasingly popular markup language.\n",
    "* ...offers features available in typical Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) such as code completion and easy access to help.\n",
    "* ...has LaTeX support. \n",
    "* ...can be saved and easily shared in the .ipynb [JSON](https://www.json.org/) (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation &ndash; syntax for storing and exchanging data).\n",
    "* ...can be kept under version control (e.g., with git).\n",
    "* ...be rendered and viewed online. \n",
    "* ...can be exported to multiple formats, including html and pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter vs. IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "[Brian Granger](https://physics.calpoly.edu/bgranger) and [Fernando Pérez](http://fperez.org/) created IPython (**I**nteractive **Python**) as an implementation of Python for literate programming, taking advantage of improved web browser technologies (e.g., HTML5). IPython notebooks quickly gained popularity (they were a great alternative to Mathematica and Maple as well), and in 2013 the IPython team won a Sloan Foundation Grant to accelerate development of this technology. The IPython Notebook concept was expanded upon to allow for additional programming languages, which became project Jupyter (why \"Jupyter\"? See [this](https://github.com/jupyter/design/wiki/Jupyter-Logo). IPython itself is now focused on the interactive Python project per se, part of which is providing a Python kernel for Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your Jupyter notebooks will typically open in IPython as well, but will not allow you Jupyter-only features* (of course!)  "

    "### Using `tmux`\n",
    "You may notice that jupyter locks up the terminal you launch it from until it is closed. This can be particularly frustrating, and there is an elegant solution. Enter `tmux`!\n",
    "\n",
    "`tmux` is a \"terminal multiplexer\", allowing you to run terminal sessions independent of (or \"detatched\" from) a terminal window. You can install tmux using apt:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "sudo apt install tmux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detaching and Reattaching\n",
    "To run jupyter in a tmux session, start tmux using the command `tmux`.From here you can use the tmux terminal as you would your usual terminal session (so launch `jupyter notebook` as before), however if at any time you decide that you want to do something else, you can **detach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detach your terminal window from the session, use the shortcut `ctrl+b, d` (ctrl+b, then let go of that and hit d). This kicks you back to the normal terminal, however your other session is still running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see which sessions are currently running, use\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "tmux ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And to attach to the session:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "tmux a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: you can attach to a session from a different terminal window or even terminal program!*\n",
    "\n",
    "To quit tmux entirely, just quit the terminal session either with `ctrl+d` or `exit`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use `tmux`?\n",
    "While this is mostly just a quality of life suggestion, countless are the times that I have accidentally closed my terminal only to find that my jupyter session has also died. By decoupling the window from the terminal session, this no longer happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally tmux is absolutely invaluable when running long jobs on a remote server. In this case you can simply disconnect from the tmux session on the remote server. Then you can log in later (and/or from a different computer) and **reattach to the interactive session** (using `tmux a`) to check progress. In combination with good logging for long jobs, this can make your life infinitely easier."

    "\n",
    "The two main elements (and the associated syntax) you need to know to modify the content of a Jupyter nb are as follows.

To convert it to a text cell, hit `M` immediately after inserting the cell, or if you have clicked elsewhere after inserting the cell, by clicking on the edge of the new cell and *then* hitting `M`. You can now either enter and modify text or code:   \n",
