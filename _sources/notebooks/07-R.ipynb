    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "R is a freely available statistical software with strong  programming capabilities widely used by professional scientists around  the world. It was based on the commercial statistical software `S` by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka. The first stable version appeared  in 2000. It was essentially designed for *programming* statistical analysis and data-mining. It became the standard tool for data analysis and visualization in biology in a matter of just 10 years or so. It is also frequently used for mathematical modelling in biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter aims to lay down the foundations for you to use R for scientific computing in biology by exploiting it full potential as a fully featured object-oriented programming language. Specifically, this chapter aims at teaching you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic R syntax and programming conventions, assuming you have never set your eyes on R\n",
    "* Principles of data processing and exploration (including visualization) using R\n",
    "* Principles of clean and efficient programming using R\n",
    "* To generate publication quality graphics in R \n",
    "* To develop reproducible data analysis \"work flows\" so you (or anybody else) can run and re-run your analyses, graphics outputs and all, in R\n",
    "* To make R simulations more efficient using vectorization\n",
    "* To find and fix errors in R code using debugging \n",
    "* To make data wrangling and analyses more efficient and convenient using special packages\n",
    "* Some additional, advanced topics (accessing databases, building your own packages, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why R?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many commercial statistical (minitab, SPSS, etc) software  packages in the world that are mouse-driven, warm, and friendly, and  have lots of statistical tests and plotting/graphing capabilities. Why not just use them? Here are some very good reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* R has numerous tried and tested packages for data-handling and processing \n",
    "* R provides basically every statistical test you'll ever need and is constantly being improved. You can tailor your analyses rather than trying to use the more limited options each statistical software package can offer.\n",
    "* R has excellent graphing and visualization capabilities and produce publication-quality graphics that can be re-produced with scripts &ndash; you won't get [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) mouse-clicking your way though graphing and re-graphing your data every time you change your analysis!\n",
    "* It also has good capabilities for mathematical calculations, including matrix algebra \n",
    "* R is scriptable, so you can build a perfectly repeatable record of your analysis. This in itself has several advantages:\n",
    "   * You can never replicate *exactly* the same analysis with all the same steps using a point-and-click approach/software. With R you can reproduce your full analysis for yourself (in the future!), your colleagues, your supervisor/employer, and any journal you might want to submit your work to.\n",
    "   * You may need to rerun your analysis every time you get new data. Once you have it all in a R script, you can just rerun your     analysis and go home!\n",
    "   * You may need to tweak your analysis many times (new data, supervisor changes mind, you change mind, paper reviewers want you do something differently). Having the analysis recorded as script then allows you to do so by revising the relevant parts of your analysis with relatively little pain.  \n",
    "* R is freely available for all common computer operating systems &ndash; if you want a copy on your laptop, help yourself  at the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org).\n",
    "* Being able to program in R means you can develop and automate your own data handling, statistical analysis, and graphing/plotting, a set of skills you are likely to need in many, if not most careers paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Would you ever need anything other than R?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to program R means you can develop and automate your statistical analyses and the generation of figures into a reproducible work flow. For many of you, using R as your only programming language will do the job. However, if your work also includes extensive numerical simulations, manipulation of very large matrices, bioinformatics, relational database access and manipulation, or web development, you will be better-off *also* knowing another programming language that is more versatile and computationally efficient (like Python or Julia).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing R\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a college computer, R will likely already be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise you can follow [these instructions](https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/rstudio.html) to install R on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, on Ubuntu Linux, it is as simple as typing the following in terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be using an IDE for R. Please re-visit the \"To IDE or not to IDE\" section of the [Introduction](../intro.md) if you are not familiar with IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly look at the bare-bones R interface and command line  interface (CLI), and then switch to an IDE like Visual Studio Code or RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch R (From Applications menu on Window or Mac, from terminal in  Linux/Ubuntu) &mdash; it should look something like this (on Linux/Ubuntu or Mac terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure-md} R-Linux-console\n",

    "<img src=\"./graphics/R_Linux.png\" alt=\"R in UNIX/Linux\" width=\"500px\">\n",

    "## R basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets get started with some R basics. You will be working by entering R commands interactively at the R user prompt (`>`). Up and down arrow keys scroll through your command history. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful R commands\n",
    "\n",
    "|Command| What it does|\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "| `ls()`| list all the variables in the work space |\n",
    "| `rm('a', 'b')`| remove variable(s) `a` and `b`|\n",
    "| `rm(list=ls())`| remove all variable(s)|\n",
    "| `getwd()`| get current working directory |\n",
    "| `setwd('Path')`| set working directory to `Path`|\n",
    "| `q()`| quit R |\n",
    "| `?Command`| show the documentation of `Command`|\n",
    "| `??Keyword`| search the all packages/functions with 'Keyword', \"fuzzy search\"|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baby steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in any programming language, you will need to use \"variables\" to store information in a R session's workspace. Each variable has a reserved location in your [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory), and takes up \"real estate\" in it &mdash; that is when you create a variable you reserve some space in your computer's memory.\n",

These two have a very distinct meaning in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like R and Python. A data structure is just a \"dumb\" container for data (e.g., a vector). An object, on the other hand can be a data structure, but also any other variable or a function in your R environment. R, being an OOP language, converts everything in the current environment to an object so that it knows what to do with each such entity &mdash; each object type has its own set of rules for operations and manipulations that R uses when interpreting your commands. \n",

The problem is that dataframes can be too slow when large numbers of mathematical calculations or operations (e.g., matrix - vector multiplications or other linear algebra operations) need to be performed. In such cases, you will need to convert a dataframe to a matrix. But for statistical analyses, plotting, and writing output of standard R analyses to a file, data frames are more convenient. Dataframes also allow you to refer to columns by name (using `$`), which is often convenient.\n",

These are typically based on a iterative formula that generates a sequence of random numbers, starting with a first number called the \"**seed**\".

However, this  period is so long that it can be ignored for most practical purposes. So effectively, `rnorm` has an enormous list that it cycles through.

You can set the seed once at the beginning of the code &mdash; ensuring repeatability, retaining (pseudo) randomness. Once  debugged, if you want, you can remove the set seed line."

    "In using R for an analysis, you will likely use and create several files. As in the case of bash and Python based projects, in R projects as well, you should keep your workflow well organized. For example, it is sensible to create a folder (directory) to keep all code files together. You can then set R to work from this directory, so that files are easy to find and run &mdash; this will be your \"working directory\" (more on this below). Also, you don't want to mix code files with data and results files. So you should create separate directories for these as well. \n",

    "Some details on each kind of file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* *R script files*: These are plain text files containing all the R code needed for an analysis. These should  be created with a text editor, typically part of some smart code editor like vscode, or RStudio, and saved with the extension `*.R`. You should *never* use Word to save or edit these files as R can only read code from plain text files.\n",
    " \n",
    "* *Text data files* These are files of data in plain text format containing one or more columns of data (numbers, strings, or both). Although there are several format options, we will typically be using `csv` files, where the data entries are separated by commas. These are easy to create and export from Excel (if that's what you use...).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Results output files* These are a plain text files containing your results, such the the summary of output of a regression or ANOVA analysis. Typically, you will output your results in a table format where the columns are separated by commas (csv) or tabs (tab-delimited). \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Graphics files* R can export graphics in a wide range of formats. This can be done automatically from R code and we will look at this later but you can also select a graphics window (e.g., in RStudio) and click `File` $\\triangleright$ `Save as...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Rdata files* You can save any data loaded or created in R, including outputs of statistical analyses and other things, into a single`Rdata` file. These are not plain text and can only be read by R, but can hold all the data from an analysis in a single handy location. We will not use these much in this course.  \n",

    "\n",
    "&#9733; Create a sensibly-named directory (e.g., `MyRCoursework`, `week3`, etc, depnding on which course you are on) in an appropriate location on your computer. If you are using a college Windows computer, you may need to create it in your `H:` drive. Avoid including spaces in your file or directory names, as this will often create problems when you share your file or directory with somebody else. Many software programs do not handle spaces in file/directory names well. Use underscores instead of spaces. For example, instead of `My R Coursework`, use `My_R_Coursework` or `MyRCoursework`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "&#9733; Create subdirectories *within this directory* called `code`, `data`, and `results`. Remember,  commands in all programming languages are case-sensitive when it comes to reading directory path names, so `code` is not the same as `Code`!\n",

In other words, \"ddply\" means: take a data frame, split it up, do something to it, and return a data frame. Look up [this](http://seananderson.ca/2013/12/01/plyr.html) and \n",

There you will also see a comparison of speed of `ddply` vs `by` at the latter web page; `ddply` is actually slower than other vectorized methods, as it trades-off compactness of use for some of the speed of vectorization! Indeed, overall functions in `plyr` can be slow if you are working with very large datasets that involve a lot of subsetting (analyses by many groups or grouping variables). \n",

A good option for this is to convert warnings to errors using the [`stopifnot()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/stopifnot.html). This is a bit like `try` (which we will cover below, and we also covered in [Python Chapter I](Python:errors)). "

    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found an error, you need to debug it. Assuming you have an idea about where (or the general area) in your code the error is, a simple way to debug is to use the  `browser()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `browser()` function allows you to insert a breakpoint in your script (where the running of the script is stopped) and then step through your code. Place it within your script at the point you want to examine local variables  (e.g. inside a `for` loop). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example usage of `browser()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "&#9733; Type the following in a script file called `browse.R` and save in `code`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "Exponential <- function(N0 = 1, r = 1, generations = 10) {\n",
    "  # Runs a simulation of exponential growth\n",
    "  # Returns a vector of length generations\n",
    "  \n",
    "  N <- rep(NA, generations)    # Creates a vector of NA\n",
    "  \n",
    "  N[1] <- N0\n",
    "  for (t in 2:generations) {\n",
    "    N[t] <- N[t-1] * exp(r)\n",
    "    browser()\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return (N)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "plot(Exponential(), type=\"l\", main=\"Exponential growth\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The script will be run till the first iteration of the `for` loop and the console will enter the browser mode, which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "Browse[1]>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can examine the variables present at that point. Also, at the browser console, you can enter expressions as normal, or use a few particularly useful debug commands (similar to the Python debugger):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n`: single-step \n",
    "* `c`: exit browser and continue\n",
    "* `Q`: exit browser and abort, return to top-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We will not cover advanced debugging here as we did [in Python Chapter I](Python:errors), but look up `traceback()` (to find where the errors(s) are when a program crashes), and `debug()` (to debug a whole function).\n",

    "The big strength of R is that users can easily build and share packages through [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are R packages for practically all statistical and mathematical analysis you might conceive, so check them out before reinventing the wheel. Visit [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and go to packages to see a list and a brief description. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows and Macs and Linux, you can install a package within R by using the `install.packages()`command. \n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\"))\n",

    "(three packages in this hypothetical example)\n",

    "You can also use the RStudio GUI to install packages using your mouse and menu. \n",
