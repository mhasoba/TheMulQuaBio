# Now extend this script so that it captures the Kingdom, 
# Phylum and Species name for each species and prints it out to screen neatly.

# Hint: you may want to use re.findall(my_reg, text)...
# Keep in mind that there are multiple ways to skin this cat! 
# Your solution may involve multiple regular expression calls (easier!), or a single one (harder!)
