    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In biology, we often use statistics to compare competing hypotheses in order to work out the simplest explanation for some data. This often involves collecting several explanatory variables that describe different hypotheses and then fitting them together in a single model, and often including interactions between those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all likelihood, not all of these model *terms* will be important. If we remove unimportant terms, then the explanatory power of the model will get worse, but might not get significantly worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.\"* \n",
    ">\n",
    "> &ndash; *Albert Einstein*\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to paraphrase:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we will look at is to start with a *maximal model* — the model that contains everything that might be important — and simplify it towards the *null model* — the\n",
    "model that says that none of your variables are important. Hopefully, there is a point somewhere in between where you can't remove any further terms without making the model significantly worse: this is called the *minimum adequate model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"fig:minmodflow\"></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chapter aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this chapter[$^{[1]}$](#fn1) is to learn how to build and then simplify complex models by removing non-explanatory terms, to arrive at the *Minimum Adequate Model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The process of model simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "Model simplification is an iterative process. The flow diagram below shows how it works: at each stage you try and find an acceptable simplification. If successful, then you start again with the new simpler model and try and find a way to simplify this, until eventually, you can't find anything more to remove.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we can use an $F$-test to compare two models and see if they have significantly different explanatory power (there are also other ways to do this, such as using the Akaike Information Criterion, but we will not cover this here). In this context, the main thing to remember is that significance of the $F$-test used to compare a model and its simplified counterpart is a *bad* thing — it means that we've removed a term from the fitted model that makes it *significantly* worse.\n",

    "\n",

This is an interaction of four variables capturing how the slope for litter size changes for different body masses for species in different trophic groups and which are arboreal or ground dwelling. Does this seem easy to understand?\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's simplify the model we fitted above. Model simplification is not as straightforward as just dropping terms. Each time you remove a term from a model, the model will change: the model will get worse, since some of the sums of squares are no longer explained, but the remaining variables may partly compensate for this loss of explanatory power. The main point is that if it gets only a little worse, its OK, as the tiny amount of additional variation explained by the term you removed is not really worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how much is \"tiny amount\"? This is what we will learn now by using the $F$-test.   Again, remember: significance of the $F$-test used to compare a model and its simplified counterpart is a *bad* thing — it means that we've removed a term from the fitted model that makes the it *significantly* worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is: *what terms can you remove from a model*? Obviously, you only want to remove non-significant terms, but there is another rule – you cannot remove a main effect or an interaction while those main effects or interactions are present in a more complex interaction. For example, in the model `y ~ a + b + c + a:b + a:c + b:c`, you cannot drop `c` without dropping both `a:c` and `b:c`.\n",
