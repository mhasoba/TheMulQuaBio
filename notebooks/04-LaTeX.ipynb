    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In your research, you will produce papers, reports and&mdash;very importantly&mdash;your thesis. These documents can be written using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor (e.g., Word). However, an alternative especially suited for scientific publications is LaTeX. In LaTeX, the document is written  in a text file (`.tex`) with certain typesetting (tex) syntax. Text formatting is done using markups (like HTML). The file is then \"compiled\" (like source code of a programming language) into a file &ndash; typically in PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why $\\LaTeX$?\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input is a small, portable text file\n",
    "* LaTeX compilers are freely available for all OS'\n",
    "* Exactly the same result on any computer (not true for Word, for example)\n",
    "* LaTeX produces beautiful, professional looking docs\n",
    "* Images are easy to embed and annotate \n",
    "* Mathematical formulas (esp complex ones) are easy to write\n",
    "* LaTeX is very stable &ndash; current version basically same since 1994! (9 major versions of MS Word since 1994 &ndash; with compatibility issues)\n",
    "* LaTeX is free!\n",
    "* You can focus on content, and not worry so much about formatting while writing \n",
    "* An increasing number of Biology journals provide $\\LaTeX$ templates, making formatting quicker. \n",
    "* Referencing (bibliography) is easy (and can also be version controlled) and works with tools like Mendeley and Zotero\n",
    "* Plenty of online support available &ndash; your question has probably already been answered\n",
    "* You can integrate LaTeX into a workflow to auto-generate lengthy and complex documents (like your thesis).\n",

    "<small> <center> <figcaption> LaTeX documents scale up better then WYSIWYG editors.</figcaption></center></small>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of $\\LaTeX$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It has a steeper learning curve.\n",
    "* Can be difficult to manage revisions with multiple authors &ndash; especially if they don't use LaTeX! (Cue: Windows on a virtual machine!)\n",
    "* Tracking changes are not available out of the box (but can be enabled using a suitable package) \n",
    "* Typesetting tables can be a bit complex.\n",
    "* Images and floats are easy to embed, and won't jump around like Word, but if you don't use the right package, they can be difficult to place where you want!"
