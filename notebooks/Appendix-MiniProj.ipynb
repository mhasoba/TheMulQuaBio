    "We have talked a lot about workflows and confronting models with data. It's time to do something concrete with all the techniques you have been learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMEE Miniproject gives you an opportunity to try the \"whole nine yards\" of developing and implementing a workflow and delivering a \"finished product\" — where you ask and answer a scientific question in biology (potentially involving multiple sub-questions/hypotheses). It will give you an opportunity to perform a \"dry run\" of executing your actual dissertation project, and you may use it to trial some of the techniques and/or explore some of the data/theory you might use in your Dissertation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general question you will address is:** *What mathematical model best fits an empirical dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of this as testing a set of alternative hypotheses — every alternative hypothesis is nothing but an alternative model to describe an observed phenomenon, as you will have learned in the lectures on model fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Project \n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose a dataset and set of alternative models from the options provided to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read the papers in the [Readings](#Readings) section* — these will help orient you in the right direction for tackling your miniproject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Miniproject must satisfy the following criteria (and follow the accompanying guidelines):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should employ all the biological computing tools you have learned so far: shell (bash) scripting, git, LaTeX, R, and Python. Using these tools, you will build a workflow that starts with the data and ends with a written report (in LaTeX). How you choose the different tools (e.g., Python vs R) is your choice. This is part of the assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *At least* two different models (hypotheses) must be fitted to the data. The models should be fitted and selected using an appropriate method. Specifically, irrespective of the problem/dataset you choose (see below), use Nonlinear Least Squares (NLLS) to fit $\\ge 2$ alternative models to data, followed by model selection using AIC and BIC (read the Johnson and Omland 2005 paper). You may choose additional means for model comparison/selection beyond these.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The project should be fully reproducible. Write a script that \"glues\" the workflow together and runs it, from data processing to model fitting to plotting (e.g., in R) to compilation of the LaTeX written report (*More detailed instructions on report below*). Look back at the TheMulQuaBio to see how you would run the different components. For example, we have covered how to run R and compile $\\LaTeX$ using the `subprocess` module in Python. The assessor should be able to run just this script to get everything to work without errors. Use Python or to write this main script. If using bash, call it `run_MiniProject.sh` and if using Python, called it  `run_MiniProject.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will be given lectures and practicals on model fitting before you start on your Miniproject.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should,\n",
    "\n",
    "* be written in LaTeX  using the article document class, in 11pt (any font will do, within reason!).\n",
    "\n",
    "* be double-spaced, with *continuous* line numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* have a title, author name with affiliation and wordcount (next point) on a separate title page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* have an introduction with objectives of the study, and appropriate additional sections such as methods, data, results, discussion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* should contain in the *Methods* a sub-section called \"Computing tools\" which states briefly how each of the three scripting language (bash, R, Python) and what packages within them were used and a justification of why.\n",
    "\n",
    "* must contain $\\leq$3500 words *excluding the contents of the title page, references, and Figure or Table captions+legends*; there should be a word count at the beginning of the document (typically using the `texcount` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "* have references properly cited in text and formatted in a list using bibtex.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the writeup, you probably should read the *general* (*not* word count, formatting etc.) dissertation writing guidelines given in the Silwood Masters Student Guidebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Add, commit and push all your work to your bitbucket repository using a directory called `MiniProject` at the same level as the Week1, Week2 etc. directories, by the Miniproject deadline given in your course guidebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage you are not going to be told you how to organize your project — that's part of the marking criteria (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Marking criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equal weightage will be given to the code+workflow and writeup components — each component will be marked to a max of 100 pts and then rescaled to a single mark / 100 using equal weightage*\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessor will be looking for the following while assessing your submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A well-organized project where code, results, data, etc., are easy to locate, inspect, and use. In the project's README also include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Any dependencies or special packages the user/marker should be aware of\n",
    "\n",
    "    * What each package you used is for\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Version of each language used\n",
    "\n",
    "* A project that runs smoothly, without any errors once the appropriate script (i.e., `run_MiniProject.py` or `run_MiniProject.sh`) is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A report that contains all the components indicated above in \"The Report\" subsection, with some original thought and synthesis in the **Introduction** and **Discussion** sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality of the presentation of the graphics and tables in your report, as well as any plots showing model fits to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The marking criteria you may refer to is the [summative marking criteria](./MARKING_CRITERIA.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Model Fitting Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick from one of the following three options. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thermal Performance Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question \n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon biochemical (mechanistic) principles  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to the thermal responses of metabolic traits?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a \"hot\" (no pun intended!) topic in biology. On the *ecological side*, because the temperature-dependence of metabolic rate sets the rate of intrinsic $r_\\text{max}$ (papers by Savage et al., Brown et al.) as well as interactions between species, it has a strong effect on population dynamics. In this context, note that 99.9% of life on earth is ectothermic! On the *evolutionary side*, the temperature-dependence of fitness and species interactions also means that warmer environments may have stronger rates of evolution. This may be compounded by the fact that mutation rates may also increase with temperature (papers by Gillooly et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `ThermRespData.csv`. It contains a subset of the full \"BioTraits\" database. This subset contains hundreds of \"thermal responses\" for growth, respiration and photosynthesis rates in plants and bacteria (both aquatic and terrestrial). These data were collected through lab experiments across the world, and compiled by various people over the years. The field names are defined in a file called `BiotraitsTemplateDescription.pdf`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `OriginalTraitValue` (the trait values responding to temperature), and `ConTemp` (the temperature). Individual thermal response curves can be identified by `ID` values --- each `ID` corresponds to one thermal performance curve."

    "\n",
    "$$\\label{eq:quad}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are phenomenological models, with the parameters $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$ lacking any mechanistic interpretation. $x$ is the independent variable (in this case Temperature, $T$) \n",
    "\n",
    "Another phenomenological model option is the Briere model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = B_0 T (T-T_0) \\sqrt{T_m-T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T$ is temperature, $T_0$ and $T_m$ are the minimum and maximum feasible temperatures for the trait (below or above which the traits goes to zero), and $B_0$ is a normalization constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Schoolfield model (Schoolfield et al 1981) is a mechanistic option that is based upon thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\label{eq:schoolf}\n",

    "## Functional Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question \n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon foraging theory (mechanistic) principles  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to functional responses data across species?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In ecological parlance, a functional response is the relationship between a consumer's (e.g., predator) biomass consumption rate and abundance of the target resource (e.g., prey). Functional responses arise from fundamental biological and physical constraints on consumer-resource interactions (e.g., Holling 1959, Pawar et al, 2012), and determine the rate of biomass flow between species in ecosystems across the full scale of sizes, from the smallest (e.g., microbes) to the largest (e.g., blue whales). Functional responses also play a key sole in determining the stability (responses to perturbations) of the food webs that underpin ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `CRat.csv`. It contains measurements of rates of consumption of a single resource (e.g., prey, plants) species' by a consumer species (e.g., predators, grazers). These data were collected through lab and field experiments across the world. The field names are defined in a file called `BiotraitsTemplateDescription.pdf`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `N_TraitValue` (The number of resources consumed per consumer per unit time), and `ResDensity` (the resource abundance). Individual functional response curves can be identified by `ID` values --- each `ID` corresponds to one curve. Or you can reconstruct them as unique combinations of `Citation` (where the functional response dataset came from), `ConTaxa` (consumer species ID), `ResTaxa` (resource species ID)."

    "\n",
    "Again, the simplest mathematical models you can use are the phenomenological quadratic and cubic polynomial models, that is eqns. \\ref{eq:quad} and \\ref{eq:cubic} (replace $x$ with resource abundance).\n",

    "Here, $x_R$ is resource density (Mass / Area or Volume), $a$ is consumer's search rate (Area or Volume / Time ), and  $h$ is handling time of the consumer for that resource (time taken to overpower and ingest it). \n",

    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon population growth (mechanistic) theory  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to functional responses data across species?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluctuations in the abundance (density) of single populations may play a crucial role in ecosystem dynamics and emergent functional characteristics, such as rates of carbon fixation or disease transmission. A population grows exponentially while its abundance is low and resources are not limiting (the Malthusian principle). This growth then slows and eventually stops as resources become limiting. There may also be a time lag before the population growth really takes off at the start. We will focus on microbial (specifically, bacterial) growth rates. Bacterial growth in batch culture follows a distinct set of phases; lag phase, exponential phase and stationary phase. During the lag phase a suite of transcriptional machinery is activated, including genes involved in nutrient uptake and metabolic changes, as bacteria prepare for growth. During the exponential growth phase, bacteria divide at a constant rate, the population doubling with each generation. When the carrying capacity of the media is reached, growth slows and the number of cells in the culture stabilises, beginning the stationary phase. Traditionally, microbial growth rates were measured by plotting cell numbers or culture density against time on a semi-log graph and fitting a straight line through the exponential growth phase &ndash; the slope of the line gives the maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$). Models have since been developed which we can use to describe the whole sigmoidal bacterial growth curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `LogisticGrowthData.csv`. It contains measurements of change in biomass or number of cells of microbes over time. These data were collected through lab experiments across the world. The field names are defined in a file called  `LogisticGrowthMetaData.csv`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `PopBio` (abundance), and `Time`. Single population growth rate curves can be identified by as unique  temperature-species-medium-citation-replicate combinations (concatenate them to get a new string variable that identifies unique growth curves).\n",

    "*All the following parameters and variables are in SI units*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet again, the simplest mathematical models you can use are the phenomenological quadratic and cubic polynomial models, that is eqns. \\ref{eq:quad} and \\ref{eq:cubic} (replace $x$ with Time). A Polynomial model may be able to capture decline in population size after some maximum value (the carrying capacity) has been reached (the \"death phase\" of population growth). \n",
    "\n",
    "A classical somewhat mechanistic model (recall the Modeling Lecture), is the logistic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_t =   \\frac{N_0  N_{max} e^{r t}}{N_{max} + N_0 (e^{r t} - 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $N_t$ is population size at time $t$, $N_0$ is initial population size, $r$ is maximum growth rate (AKA $r_\\text{max}$), and $N_{max}$ is carrying capacity (commonly denoted by $K$ in the ecological literature).\n",

    "Other popular models are the modified Gompertz model (Zwietering et. al., 1990), the Baranyi model (Baranyi, 1993), and the Buchanan model (or three-phase logistic model; Buchanan, 1997). The Buchanan model in particular is capable of capturing the lag phase before the population starts growing exponentially, often seen in microbial population growth. An example of fitting these models is available in the [model fitting appendix](./Appendix-ModelFitting.ipynb#Population-growth-rate-example).   \n",
    "\n",
    "The modified Gompertz model has been used frequently in the literature to model bacterial growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\label{eq:Gompertz}\n",
    "N_t = A e^{-e^{\\frac{r_{max}e(t_{lag} - t)}{A} + 1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$) is the tangent to the inflection point, $t_{lag}$ is the x-axis intercept to this tangent (duration of the delay before the population starts growing exponentially) and $A$ is the asymptote ($A = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{max}}{N_0}\\right)$), $N_0$ is initial cell culture (Population) density, $N_{max}$ is maximum population density (aka \"carrying capacity\"), and  .\n",
    "\n",
    "The Baranyi model (eq. \\ref{eq:Baranyi}) introduces a new dimensionless parameter $h_{0}$ which represents the initial physiological state of the cells. The length of the lag phase is determined by the value of $h_0$ at inoculation and the post-inoculation environment.  Thus the definition of lag is independent from the shape of the growth curve, and the effect of the previous environment is separated from the effects of the present environment. This allows modeling growth without a lag period following inoculation from media favorable to growth to new media also favorable to growth. One formulation given is:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$ \\label{eq:Baranyi}\n",
    "N_t = N_0 + r_{max}A_t - \\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{e^{r_{max}A_t} -1}{e^{N_{max} - N_0}} \\right) ,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$ \\label{eq:Baranyi_A}\n",
    "A_t = t + \\frac{1}{r_{max}} \\cdot \\ln \\left( \\frac{e^{-r_{max}t} + h_{0}}{1 + h_{0}} \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, $r_{max}$ and $h_0$ can be related to obtain the lag time, $t_{lag}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\label{eq:Baranyi_lag}\n",
    "t_{lag} = \\frac{\\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{h_0}\\right)}{r_{max}},\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "taking us back to the same four parameters as the Gompertz model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Buchanan model, or \"three-phase logistic model\" is relatively simple:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Creates unique ids so that you can identify unique datasets (e.g., single thermal responses or functional responses). *This may not always be necessary because your data might already contain a field that delineates single curves (e.g., an `ID` field/column)* \n",
    "* Filters out datasets with less than $x$ data points, where $x$ is the minimum number of data points needed to fit the models. Note that this step is not necessary because in any case, the model fitting (or estimation of goodness of fit statistics) will fail for datasets with small sample sizes anyway, and you can then filter these datasets *after* the NLLS fitting script (see below) has finished running and you are in the analysis phase.  \n",

    "* Saves the modified data to one or more csv file(s).\n",

    "* Does the NLLS fitting.\n",
    "    * If you choose Python for this use `lmfit` (look up submodules `minimize`, `Parameters`, `Parameter`, and `report_fit`. *Have a look through* <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py>, especially <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#minimize> .

    "### Obtaining starting values \n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge for NLLS fitting is finding starting values. Ideally, you should determine starting values specific to each dataset (e.g., single thermal performance, functional response, or population growth rate curve) that you are trying to fit a model to. To do so, understanding how each parameter in the model corresponds to features of the actual data is key. For example, in the Gompertz population growth rate model(eq. \\ref{eq:Gompertz}), your starting values generator would essentially be an algorithm which, for each dataset,   \n",
    "*  Calculates a starting value for $r_{max}$ by searching for the steepest slope of the growth curve using the first few data points (fitting a straight line using OLS)\n",
    "* Calculates a starting value of $t_{lag}$ by intersecting the fitted line with the x (time)-axis \n",
    "* Calculates a starting value for the asymptote $A$ as the highest data (abundance) value in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a good strategy to optimize fits (and maximize how many dataseta are successfully fitted to a non-linear model) is to not sample starting values from a distribution. For example, you can choose a gaussian (high confidence in mean of parameter) or a uniform distribution (low confidence in mean, high confidence in the range of values that the parameter can take) with the mean being the value you inferred from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We suggest you write a separate script/module/function that calculates starting values for the model parameters.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final plotting and analysis script  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can import the results from the previous step and plot every curve with the two (or more) models (or none, if nothing converges) overlaid. Doing this will help you identify poor fits visually and help you decide whether the previous, NLLS fitting script can be further optimized (e.g., by improving the starting values generator). All plots should be saved in a single separate sub-directory. This script will also perform any analyses of the results of the Model fitting, for example to summarize which model(s) fit(s) best, and address any biological questions involving co-variates.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Report compiling script\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the $\\LaTeX$ source code and a (typically, Bash) script that compiles it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A single script to run them all\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, write a Python or Bash script called `run_MiniProject.py` or `run_MiniProject.sh` respectively, which runs the whole project, right down to compilation of the LaTeX  document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing all this may seem a bit scary at the start. However, if you approach the problem systematically and methodically, you will soon be on your way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some suggested first steps to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the data in R or Python (e.g., using Jupyter). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a preliminary version of the plotting script without the fitted models overlaid. That will also give you a feel for the data and allow you to see (literally) what shapes the curves can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the models you will be fitting. Basically, be able to plot them. Write them as functions in your Python/R script (you can then re-use these functions in your NLLS fitting script as well). Then do some plotting of the functions (you can suppress or sandbox those code lines for exploratory plotting of the functions in the final product).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figure out, using a minimal example (say, with one, \"nice-looking\" thermal performance, functional response, or population growth curve/dataset) to see how the NLLS fitting package and its commands work. This is your minimal example\n",
    "\n",
    "* next, write a loop over all unique datasets (data curves) using the `try` to catch errors in case the fitting doesn't converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*One thing to note is that you may need to do the NLLS fitting on the logarithm of the function (and therefore, the data) to facilitate convergence.*"
